Week Oct26 - Nov1
Set up android development environment. Get familiar with android development. Learned about android app's life cycle
and basic jni development. Wrote few easy apps using SDK.
I have a hard time in working with NDK. I failed to run any app with NDK. Maybe the version of NDK is not compatible
with my SDK.
I still have very limited understanding on how NDK works.

Week Nov2 - Nov 8
We had a group meeting. We collected ideas about what our app should like. We decided to build a social networking app.
We came up with some basic functions.Our app will exchange data with nearby people. If both of you opened this app and
the distance you is close enough. Then each other will recieve the message they sent.
Then we distributed our work. I will in charge of some c programming to deal with the synchronizaton issue.

Week Nov9 - Now 22
Hachthon day.
We planed to write only In Java and C and we seperated to two groups. One group for C code the other for Java code.
I am in the group of C code. 
We designed the ER diagram for our database and ready to implement.
We find out that the database from cpanel is down, so we have to conduct test on local host.
Turned out that mysql is not supported in SDK or NDK, It seems that we are in a deadend.
Java part is working, We decided to use Java to connect with php, then use php to query database. I am in charge of
a parllel implementaton of computing the distance of huge amounts of  points from longitude and latitude.
Every group member finished their work.
The structure and building parts of our app is done.
